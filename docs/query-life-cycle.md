# Query Life Cycle

1) **FROM** and **JOIN**:
    - Data are loaded from the sources specified in the `FROM` clause.
    - If `JOIN` is present, data is combined based on the join conditions.
2) **WHERE**:
    - Filters rows based on conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause.
    - Filtering happens at the raw data level before any grouping or calculations.
3) **DISTINCT**:
    - If the `DISTINCT` clause is used, duplicate rows are removed based on the specified columns.
    - `DISTINCT` is skipped if a `GROUP BY` clause is present, as grouping inherently eliminates duplicates.
4) **GROUP BY**:
    - Data is grouped based on the columns specified in the `GROUP BY` clause.
    - This prepares grouped data for aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.
5) **SELECT**:
    - Columns, expressions, and aggregate functions defined in the `SELECT` clause are processed.
    - The output includes either aggregated data or individual columns.
6) **HAVING**:
    - Filters the results produced by the `SELECT` clause.
    - Primarily used to filter grouped data after aggregation.
7) **ORDER BY**:
    - Results are sorted based on the specified columns or expressions.
    - Sorting can be in ascending (`ASC`), descending (`DESC`) or shuffled (`SHUFFLE`) and naturally sorted (`NATSORT`) order.
8) **LIMIT** and **OFFSET**:
    - Limits the number of rows returned by the query using `LIMIT`.
    - If `OFFSET` is present, it skips a specified number of rows before returning the results.

> ⚠️ Functions can only be utilized in the `SELECT` clause. To filter results based on a function's value, use the `HAVING`
clause, and to sort results, use the `ORDER BY` clause. In both `HAVING` and `ORDER BY`, the function can only be
referenced by its alias.

**Example Query Execution**:

For the query:

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM (customers.xml).customers.customer
WHERE age > 30
GROUP BY name
HAVING total_sales > 1000
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Execution Order**:
1) **FROM** and **JOIN**:
    - Data are loaded from the employees file `customers.xml`. And using `customers.customer` as path.
2) **WHERE**:
    - Filters rows where `age > 30`.
3) **GROUP BY**:
    - Groups data by the `name` column.
4) **SELECT**:
    - Processes grouped data and calculates `SUM(sales)` for each group.
5) **HAVING**:
    - Filters groups where `total_sales > 1000`.
6) **ORDER BY**:
    - Sorts results by `total_sales` in descending order.
7) **LIMIT**:
    - Returns only the top 10 rows.
